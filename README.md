### Hi there! This project is work done for the Georgia Tech Solar Racing Team.

## This project uses Solcast API which returns API calls as a JSON. (API key is provided, but may be discontinued)
## This application takes in dates in a certain format and uses predicted weather GHI (parsed from JSON call response)
## Predicted GHI values predict expected percentage power increases (of the GT SR-3 Car) up to 2 days ahead

## Bonus feature is the expected charge increases is output as a graph which shows which hour periods show the highest increase in power percentage

## Note: As of 2022-2023, the Georgia Tech Solar Racing Team has switched from a Single Occupant Vehicle to a Multiple Occupant Vehicle design(SR-4)
